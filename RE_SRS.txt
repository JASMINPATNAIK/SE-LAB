    SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS AND SPECIFICATION

      •	A condition or capability that must be possessed by a system.
      •	A complete specification of what the proposed system should do is SRS.
      •	Requirement understanding is hard.
      • Essential to do a proper analysis and specification of requirements.
    PURPOSE OF SRS DOCUMENT
      •	Users needs have to be satisfied,but user may not understand software.
      •	Developers will develop the system,but may not know about problem domain.
    CHARACTERISTICS OF AN SRS
      •	Correctness
        Each requirement accurately represents some desired  feature in the final system
      •	Completeness
        Hardest to satisfy
      •	Unambiguous
        Without this errors will creep in
      •	Consistent
        Two requirements don’t contradict each other
      •	Verifiability
        There must exists a cost effective way of checking if software satisfies requirements
      •	Traceable
        The origin of the requirement,and how the requirement relates to software elements              can be determined
      •	Ranked for importance/stability
        Needed for prioritizing in construction
